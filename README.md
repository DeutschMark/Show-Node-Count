# Show Node Count

*This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).*  

It simply displays the current count of nodes from the currently selected path/glyph/character. It ignores components by now, which is the preferred behaviour for it’s purpose: immedeately spot a potentially incompatible master. Of course the built-in master compatibility preview in Glyphsapp is more powerfull, but not as quick in terms of counting points.

### Install

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Either:  
   Double click the `.glyphsReporter` file and confirm the dialogue in Glyphsapp to install.  
   Or:  
   Copy the `.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`). You can use subfolders (e.g. to sort plugins by author) there.
3. Restart Glyphs.

### How to use

When ever you need it, toggle `Show * Node Count` from the view menu.
