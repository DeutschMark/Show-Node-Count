# Show Node Count

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It simply displays the current count of nodes from the currently selected path/glyph/character. It ignores components by now, which is the preferred behaviour for it’s purpose: immedeately spot a potentially incompatible master. Of course the built-in master compatibility preview in Glyphsapp is more powerfull, but not as quick in terms of counting points.

### How to use

Download or clone the whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins`repo (it will contain more plugins soon) and copy the `ShowNodeCount.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), restart Glyphs and when ever you need it, toggle `Show Rotated` from the view menu.
